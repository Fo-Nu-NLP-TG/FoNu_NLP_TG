# Module 3.1: Normalization Techniques Overview

This module provides an overview of different normalization techniques used in deep learning, setting the stage for a deeper understanding of Layer Normalization.

## 3.1.1 The Need for Normalization

Normalization techniques have become essential components of modern deep neural networks for several reasons:

1. **Accelerating Training**: Normalization can significantly speed up the training process by allowing higher learning rates and reducing the number of iterations needed for convergence.

2. **Stabilizing Training**: By controlling the distribution of layer inputs, normalization helps prevent issues like vanishing and exploding gradients.

3. **Reducing Internal Covariate Shift**: Normalization techniques minimize the change in the distribution of network activations during training.

4. **Regularization Effect**: Many normalization methods have a regularizing effect, improving generalization performance.

## 3.1.2 Types of Normalization

There are several types of normalization techniques, each with its own approach to normalizing activations:

### Input Normalization

The most basic form of normalization is applied to the input data before feeding it into the network.

```python
def input_normalization(X):
    """
    Normalize input data to have zero mean and unit variance
    
    Args:
        X: Input data of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        
    Returns:
        Normalized data of same shape
    """
    mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)
    std = np.std(X, axis=0)
    return (X - mean) / std
```

### Batch Normalization

Batch Normalization normalizes the activations across the batch dimension. It was introduced by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy in 2015.

**Formula:**
$$\text{BN}(x) = \gamma \cdot \frac{x - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta$$

Where:
- $\mu_B$ is the mean computed over the batch dimension
- $\sigma_B^2$ is the variance computed over the batch dimension
- $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable parameters
- $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability

```python
def batch_norm(x, gamma, beta, eps=1e-5):
    """
    Apply batch normalization
    
    Args:
        x: Input data of shape (batch_size, features)
        gamma: Scale parameter of shape (features,)
        beta: Shift parameter of shape (features,)
        eps: Small constant for numerical stability
        
    Returns:
        Normalized data of same shape as x
    """
    # Calculate mean and variance along the batch dimension
    batch_mean = np.mean(x, axis=0)
    batch_var = np.var(x, axis=0)
    
    # Normalize
    x_norm = (x - batch_mean) / np.sqrt(batch_var + eps)
    
    # Scale and shift
    return gamma * x_norm + beta
```

### Layer Normalization

Layer Normalization normalizes the activations across the feature dimension for each sample independently. It was introduced by Jimmy Lei Ba et al. in 2016.

**Formula:**
$$\text{LN}(x) = \gamma \cdot \frac{x - \mu_L}{\sqrt{\sigma_L^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta$$

Where:
- $\mu_L$ is the mean computed over the feature dimension
- $\sigma_L^2$ is the variance computed over the feature dimension
- $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable parameters
- $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability

```python
def layer_norm(x, gamma, beta, eps=1e-5):
    """
    Apply layer normalization
    
    Args:
        x: Input data of shape (batch_size, features)
        gamma: Scale parameter of shape (features,)
        beta: Shift parameter of shape (features,)
        eps: Small constant for numerical stability
        
    Returns:
        Normalized data of same shape as x
    """
    # Calculate mean and variance along the feature dimension
    layer_mean = np.mean(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    layer_var = np.var(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    
    # Normalize
    x_norm = (x - layer_mean) / np.sqrt(layer_var + eps)
    
    # Scale and shift
    return gamma * x_norm + beta
```

### Instance Normalization

Instance Normalization normalizes each feature map independently for each sample. It's commonly used in style transfer and generative models.

**Formula:**
$$\text{IN}(x) = \gamma \cdot \frac{x - \mu_I}{\sqrt{\sigma_I^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta$$

Where:
- $\mu_I$ is the mean computed over the spatial dimensions (height and width) for each channel and each sample
- $\sigma_I^2$ is the variance computed over the spatial dimensions for each channel and each sample
- $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable parameters
- $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability

```python
def instance_norm(x, gamma, beta, eps=1e-5):
    """
    Apply instance normalization
    
    Args:
        x: Input data of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width)
        gamma: Scale parameter of shape (channels,)
        beta: Shift parameter of shape (channels,)
        eps: Small constant for numerical stability
        
    Returns:
        Normalized data of same shape as x
    """
    # Calculate mean and variance along the spatial dimensions
    # for each channel and each sample
    axes = (2, 3)  # Height and width dimensions
    instance_mean = np.mean(x, axis=axes, keepdims=True)
    instance_var = np.var(x, axis=axes, keepdims=True)
    
    # Normalize
    x_norm = (x - instance_mean) / np.sqrt(instance_var + eps)
    
    # Scale and shift (broadcasting gamma and beta)
    gamma = gamma.reshape(1, -1, 1, 1)
    beta = beta.reshape(1, -1, 1, 1)
    
    return gamma * x_norm + beta
```

### Group Normalization

Group Normalization divides the channels into groups and normalizes the features within each group. It was introduced by Yuxin Wu and Kaiming He in 2018.

**Formula:**
$$\text{GN}(x) = \gamma \cdot \frac{x - \mu_G}{\sqrt{\sigma_G^2 + \epsilon}} + \beta$$

Where:
- $\mu_G$ is the mean computed over the spatial dimensions and channel groups for each sample
- $\sigma_G^2$ is the variance computed over the spatial dimensions and channel groups for each sample
- $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable parameters
- $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability

```python
def group_norm(x, gamma, beta, G=32, eps=1e-5):
    """
    Apply group normalization
    
    Args:
        x: Input data of shape (batch_size, channels, height, width)
        gamma: Scale parameter of shape (channels,)
        beta: Shift parameter of shape (channels,)
        G: Number of groups
        eps: Small constant for numerical stability
        
    Returns:
        Normalized data of same shape as x
    """
    # Get dimensions
    N, C, H, W = x.shape
    
    # Reshape for grouping
    x = x.reshape(N, G, C // G, H, W)
    
    # Calculate mean and variance along the group, height, and width dimensions
    axes = (2, 3, 4)  # Channel subgroup, height, and width dimensions
    group_mean = np.mean(x, axis=axes, keepdims=True)
    group_var = np.var(x, axis=axes, keepdims=True)
    
    # Normalize
    x_norm = (x - group_mean) / np.sqrt(group_var + eps)
    
    # Reshape back
    x_norm = x_norm.reshape(N, C, H, W)
    
    # Scale and shift (broadcasting gamma and beta)
    gamma = gamma.reshape(1, -1, 1, 1)
    beta = beta.reshape(1, -1, 1, 1)
    
    return gamma * x_norm + beta
```

## 3.1.3 Comparison of Normalization Techniques

Each normalization technique has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different scenarios:

### Normalization Dimensions

The key difference between these techniques is the dimensions along which normalization is performed:
