# Weekly Update Workflow for FoNu_NLP_TG

This document outlines the workflow for creating and publishing weekly updates about your project progress across multiple platforms.

## Overview

Every Sunday, you'll create a weekly update that:
1. Documents your progress for the week
2. Generates content for social media platforms (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Medium)
3. Updates your project blog
4. Tracks progress across all submodules

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Analyze Your Codebase

Run the code status analyzer to identify works in progress and issues:

```bash
python tools/code_status_analyzer.py
```

This will generate a report in `tools/reports/` that identifies:
- TODOs and FIXMEs in your code
- Works in progress (marked with WIP comments)
- Known bugs and hacks

### 2. Generate the Weekly Update Template

Run the update automation script to create a new weekly update file:

```bash
python tools/update_automation.py
```

This will:
- Create a new update file in `blog/updates/` with the current week number
- Create a Medium blog post template in `blog/updates/`
- Update the blog index to include the new update
- Provide templates with sections to fill in

### 3. Fill in the Update Details

Edit the generated update file to add:
- Summary of the week's actual progress
- Completed work (fully implemented features)
- Work in progress (partially implemented features)
- Known issues and bugs
- Technical details
- Challenges and solutions
- Next steps
- Links to relevant resources

Be honest and specific about what's working and what's not.

### 4. Complete the Medium Blog Post

Edit the generated Medium blog post template to create a comprehensive post:
- Add a compelling title focused on your main accomplishment or focus
- Include technical details, code snippets, and explanations
- Add screenshots or diagrams where helpful
- Be honest about challenges and works in progress
- Provide a technical deep dive on one aspect of your work

The Medium post should be more detailed than the weekly update, providing in-depth explanations and examples.

### 5. Generate Submodule Status Report

If your repository has submodules, generate a status report:

```bash
python tools/submodule_status.py
```

Copy the generated report into your weekly update.

### 6. Customize Social Media Snippets

In the weekly update file, customize the social media snippets section:
- Twitter/X: Keep it concise (280 characters)
- LinkedIn: 1-2 paragraphs with relevant hashtags
- Medium: Create a teaser for your full blog post

### 7. Commit and Push the Update

```bash
git add blog/updates/
git add blog/index.md
git commit -m "Add weekly update for week XX"
git push
```

### 8. Prepare for Social Media Publishing

Extract the social media snippets:

```bash
python tools/social_media_publisher.py
```

This will create files with your social media content in `tools/social_media_output/`.

### 9. Publish to GitHub Pages

If you're using GitHub Pages for your blog:

```bash
python tools/update_automation.py --publish
```

This will convert your Markdown files to HTML for GitHub Pages.

### 10. Post to Social Media Platforms

Use the generated content to post updates to:
- Twitter/X: Use the content from `twitter_YYYYMMDD.txt`
- LinkedIn: Use the content from `linkedin_YYYYMMDD.txt`
- Medium: Publish the full blog post from `medium_week_XX_YYYYMMDD.md`

For Medium, you'll need to:
1. Copy the content from the Medium blog post file
2. Format it appropriately on Medium (add images, code formatting, etc.)
3. Add relevant tags for better discoverability
4. Link back to your GitHub repository

## Automation Schedule

For maximum consistency, consider setting up a reminder or calendar event every Sunday to follow this workflow.

## Tips for Effective Updates

1. **Be consistent**: Post at the same time each week
2. **Use visuals**: Include screenshots, diagrams, or charts when possible
3. **Highlight achievements**: Focus on concrete accomplishments
4. **Be honest about challenges**: Share what you learned from difficulties
5. **Include calls to action**: Invite feedback, contributions, or questions
6. **Use relevant hashtags**: Increase visibility with appropriate hashtags
7. **Cross-link platforms**: Link to your GitHub repo from social media posts

## Customizing the Process

Feel free to modify any of the scripts or templates to better suit your needs. The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable to your workflow.
