# FoNu_NLP_TG Project Blog

Welcome to the official blog for the FoNu_NLP_TG project! This blog documents our journey exploring transformer models for natural language processing tasks, with a focus on Ewe-English translation.

## About the Project

FoNu_NLP_TG ("Fo Nu" means "speak" in Ewe, and TG stands for Togo) is a research project focused on:

1. Understanding and implementing transformer architectures
2. Applying transformers to low-resource language translation
3. Developing visualization tools for NLP models
4. Exploring semantic relationships between words

Our primary goal is to improve machine translation capabilities for Togolese languages, starting with Ewe-English translation. We're exploring various approaches including fine-tuning pre-trained models, training custom transformers, and implementing hybrid methods.
