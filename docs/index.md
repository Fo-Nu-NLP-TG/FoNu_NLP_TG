# FoNu NLP TG

Welcome to the FoNu NLP TG project documentation! This project focuses on developing a transformer-based translation model between Ewe and English languages.

## About the Project

FoNu (meaning "parle" in Ewe language) NLP TG (Togo) is a project dedicated to creating high-quality machine translation tools for the Ewe language. Ewe is a Niger-Congo language spoken by approximately 4-5 million people primarily in Ghana, Togo, and parts of Benin.

Our goal is to bridge the digital language divide by providing accessible translation tools for Ewe speakers and researchers.

## Key Features

- **Transformer-based Architecture**: Implementation of the "Attention Is All You Need" architecture for neural machine translation
- **Ewe-English Translation**: Specialized components for Ewe-English translation
- **Visualization Tools**: Components for visualizing model internals and semantic relationships
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and explanations of the codebase
