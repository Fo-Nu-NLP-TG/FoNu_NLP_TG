# Introduction to FoNu NLP TG

*Posted on May 15, 2023*

Welcome to the FoNu NLP TG blog! This is where we'll share our journey in developing a transformer-based translation model for the Ewe-English language pair.

## What is FoNu NLP TG?

FoNu stands for "parle" in the Ewe language, and TG stands for Togo. Our project aims to bridge the digital language divide by creating high-quality machine translation tools for the Ewe language, which is spoken by approximately 4-5 million people primarily in Ghana, Togo, and parts of Benin.

## Why Ewe?

Ewe, like many African languages, is computationally under-resourced. Despite having millions of speakers, there are limited NLP tools and resources available for Ewe. This digital language divide means that Ewe speakers don't have the same access to information and technology as speakers of more resourced languages.

By focusing on Ewe-English translation, we hope to:

1. **Preserve and promote the Ewe language** in the digital age
2. **Facilitate communication** between Ewe speakers and the wider world
3. **Advance the state of the art** in low-resource machine translation
4. **Provide a foundation** for future research on Ewe and related languages

## Our Approach

We're implementing the transformer architecture described in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017). This architecture has revolutionized machine translation since its introduction, outperforming previous sequence-to-sequence models with recurrent neural networks.

The transformer's self-attention mechanism allows it to capture long-range dependencies in text more effectively, making it particularly suitable for translation tasks. However, applying this architecture to low-resource languages like Ewe presents unique challenges.

## Challenges

Some of the challenges we're facing include:

1. **Data scarcity**: Limited availability of high-quality parallel data
2. **Linguistic differences**: Significant structural differences between Ewe and English
3. **Morphological complexity**: Ewe has complex verbal morphology
4. **Tonal features**: Ewe is a tonal language, but this information is often lost in written text
5. **Cultural concepts**: Many Ewe terms express cultural concepts that don't have direct English equivalents

## Project Roadmap

Here's our plan for the project:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing** (Completed)
   - Compile parallel corpus from multiple sources
   - Clean and normalize the data
   - Create train/validation/test splits

2. **Model Implementation** (In Progress)
   - Implement the transformer architecture
   - Train tokenizers for Ewe and English
   - Train the model on our parallel corpus

3. **Evaluation and Analysis** (Upcoming)
   - Evaluate the model using standard metrics
   - Analyze the model's performance on different types of text
   - Identify areas for improvement

4. **Improvements and Extensions** (Future)
   - Implement data augmentation techniques
   - Explore hybrid approaches
   - Fine-tune multilingual pre-trained models

## Join Us!
