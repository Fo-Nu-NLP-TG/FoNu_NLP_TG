# Ewe-English Translation Research

This page summarizes our research on Ewe-English neural machine translation using transformer models.

## Introduction

Ewe is a Niger-Congo language spoken by approximately 4-5 million people primarily in Ghana, Togo, and parts of Benin. Despite its significant speaker population, Ewe remains computationally under-resourced, with limited availability of NLP tools and resources.

Our research focuses on developing a transformer-based neural machine translation system for the Ewe-English language pair, addressing the challenges of low-resource language translation.

## Challenges in Ewe-English Translation

Several factors contribute to the challenges in Ewe-English translation:

1. **Data scarcity**: Limited availability of high-quality parallel data
2. **Linguistic differences**: Significant structural differences between Ewe (an isolating language with tone) and English
3. **Morphological complexity**: Ewe has complex verbal morphology that doesn't align well with English
4. **Tonal features**: Ewe is a tonal language, but this information is often lost in written text
5. **Cultural concepts**: Many Ewe terms express cultural concepts that don't have direct English equivalents

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The parallel corpus for this project was compiled from multiple sources:

- Religious texts (Bible translations)
- News articles
- Educational materials
- Community-contributed translations

We applied the following preprocessing steps:

- Normalization of Unicode characters
- Removal of duplicate sentence pairs
- Filtering of very short or very long sentences
- Alignment verification to ensure proper sentence pairing
- Handling of special characters and diacritics in Ewe

### Tokenization

We used SentencePiece tokenization with a vocabulary size of 8,000 for both languages. This subword tokenization approach helps address the issue of out-of-vocabulary words, which is particularly important for morphologically rich languages like Ewe.

### Model Architecture

Our implementation follows the original transformer architecture with the following components:

- **Encoder**: 6 layers, each with multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks
- **Decoder**: 6 layers, with masked multi-head self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward networks
- **Attention**: 8 attention heads with dimension 64 per head (total dimension 512)
- **Feed-forward networks**: 2048 hidden units with ReLU activation
- **Embeddings**: 512-dimensional embeddings with learned positional encoding
- **Regularization**: Dropout rate of 0.1 applied to attention weights and feed-forward networks

### Training Configuration

The model was trained with the following hyperparameters:

- **Optimizer**: Adam with β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.98, ε = 10⁻⁹
- **Learning rate**: Custom schedule with warmup (4000 steps) followed by decay
- **Batch size**: 32 sentence pairs per batch
- **Label smoothing**: 0.1
- **Training epochs**: 30 (with early stopping based on validation loss)

## Results and Analysis

### Qualitative Analysis

Below are examples of translations produced by the model:

| Source (Ewe) | Reference Translation | Model Output | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|-------|
| Ŋdi nyuie | Good morning | [empty] | Failed to translate common greeting |
| Akpe ɖe wo ŋu | Thank you | [empty] | Failed to translate common phrase |
| Mele tefe ka? | Where am I? | ?.....?.................................................... | Partial recognition of question mark but failed translation |
| Nye ŋkɔe nye John | My name is John | "I'm " " ".. | Partial translation with quotation artifacts |
| Aleke nèfɔ ŋdi sia? | How did you wake up this morning? | years ago?ly.?...............?................................... | Incorrect translation with question mark recognition |

### Error Analysis

We identified several patterns in the model's errors:

1. **Empty translations**: The model often produced empty outputs for common phrases, suggesting issues with the training data distribution or tokenization.

2. **Repetition**: For certain inputs, the model produced repetitive outputs, indicating a failure in the stopping mechanism or overconfidence in certain tokens.

3. **Partial translations**: Some translations captured elements of the source (like question marks) but failed to produce coherent text.

4. **Semantic errors**: In cases like "mawu" (God) → "the earth", the model made semantic errors that suggest limited understanding of cultural and religious concepts.

## Model Limitations

The current implementation has several limitations:

1. **Vocabulary coverage**: The 8,000 token vocabulary may not adequately cover the lexical diversity of both languages
2. **Training data quality**: The parallel corpus may contain alignment errors or domain biases
3. **Architectural constraints**: The standard transformer architecture may not be optimal for the specific challenges of Ewe-English translation
4. **Decoding strategy**: The current greedy decoding approach limits the model's ability to generate diverse and fluent translations

## Future Work

Based on our findings, we propose several directions for future research:

### Data Augmentation

1. **Back-translation**: Generate synthetic parallel data by translating monolingual English text to Ewe using the current model
2. **Data mining**: Extract parallel sentences from comparable corpora such as Wikipedia and news websites
3. **Transfer learning**: Leverage data from related languages such as Fon and Gbe varieties

### Model Improvements

1. **Hybrid approaches**: Combine neural translation with rule-based post-processing for handling specific linguistic phenomena
2. **Advanced decoding**: Implement beam search and length normalization for improved output quality
3. **Adapter layers**: Fine-tune multilingual pre-trained models with Ewe-specific adapter layers
4. **Morphological analysis**: Incorporate explicit morphological features as additional inputs to the model

### Evaluation Enhancements

1. **Human evaluation**: Conduct systematic human evaluation with native Ewe speakers
2. **Task-based evaluation**: Assess the model's performance in downstream tasks such as information extraction
3. **Linguistic analysis**: Develop targeted test sets for specific linguistic phenomena in Ewe

## Conclusion

This research presents a transformer-based neural machine translation system for Ewe-English translation. Despite the challenges inherent in low-resource language translation, our implementation demonstrates the potential of neural approaches for African languages. The analysis of the model's performance provides valuable insights into the specific challenges of Ewe-English translation and suggests promising directions for future research.

The current limitations in translation quality highlight the need for continued investment in data collection, model development, and evaluation methodologies for low-resource languages. By addressing these challenges, we can work toward more equitable language technology that serves the needs of diverse linguistic communities.
